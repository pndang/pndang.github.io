Data Science Projects

<br>

**OPUBOD - Occupancy Prediction Using Building Operation Data**&nbsp;(Personal Project)

- A time-series machine learning project to discover useful building operation metrics for predicting occupant count; examined models include linear regression, auto-regression, and recurrent neural nets, plus statistical analyses for feature selection.

<br>

**Game Recommender**&nbsp;(Personal Project)

- Developed game recommender systems for (1) play prediction using collaborative filtering and (2) hours played prediction using latent-factor models with coordinate descent and gradient descent. All models implemented from scratch with analogous performance to those of the Surprise library from peers following a class leaderboard.

**Solar-Powered Smart Lighting for Sustainable Living**&nbsp;(Personal Project)

- Built a solar-powered data science IoT device capable of collecting live sensor data, adjusting lighting depending on environmental factors for energy efficiency, and sending data to a MySQL database using MCU on-board Wifi (synchronous communication).
- Performed an analysis of solar charging voltage under different scenarios and developed a data processing script to query/transform/analyze/visualize data.

<br>

**Illuminating Cognizance**&nbsp;(Personal Project)

- A comprehensive look into major power outages in the U.S. to assess statistical relationships (part 1) through exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, data missingness assessment, and predictive power (part 2) using supervised machine learning models and feature engineering, built in pipelines with evaluation comprising diverse accuracy metrics and cogent assessments.

Real Estate / Urban Planning Projects

<br>

**Urban Economic Determinants of Industrial Location**&nbsp;(Personal Project)

- A discussion paper on the theories of industrial location, with emphasis on environmental regulations, tax incentives, and location factors influencing the decisions to locate (or relocate) by firms. Features case studies of Amazon and the SoCal wood furniture manufacturing industry, building off key points in Beer and Clower's book "Globalization, Planning and Local Economic Development".
