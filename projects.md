**Cognitive City Twins 3 Projects Portfolio**&nbsp;(Personal & Team Project)

- A portfolio of three different, related projects about digital twins for data science and real estate, featuring a H2 Hillcrest, a mixed-use development proposal, a solar-powered IoT device collecting sensor data with cloud storage and lighting adjustments, and city twins developed in Unreal Engine 5 digitizing the built environment.
- About the city twins: My focus has been to develop the twin platforms emphasizing applicability, usability, and practicality for urban planners and real estate developers. I am very excited to showcase this work in a portfolio as I am highly passionate about it, and the topic perfectly blends real estate and technology. Not only for myself, urban digitalization and the role of technology in real estate, generally, are exciting areas that will be a component of how we determine what’s the highest and best use, perform site analysis, build a project, and even interact with lenders, equity investors, and prospective tenants; processes in which our ability to display the real estate digitally, in fun, innovative, and insightful ways, will be crucial to convey ideas effectively.
