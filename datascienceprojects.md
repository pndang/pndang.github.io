**Statistical Inference for U.S. Presidential Elections**&nbsp;(Team Project)

- A detailed analysis of twelve elections for the U.S. presidency between 1976 and 2020 for a deeper understanding of their nature; analyses performed include exploratory, goodness of fit (LRTs), similarity/dissimilarity analysis of distributions, predictive (ML), plus a fun interlude mingling of Bayesian and classical (frequentist) statistics.

**OPUBOD - Occupancy Prediction Using Building Operation Data**&nbsp;(Personal Project)

- A time-series machine learning project to discover useful building operation metrics for predicting occupant count; examined models include linear regression, auto-regression, and recurrent neural nets, plus statistical analyses for feature selection.

**Game Recommender**&nbsp;(Personal Project)

- Developed game recommender systems for (1) play prediction using collaborative filtering and (2) hours played prediction using latent-factor models with coordinate descent and gradient descent. All models implemented from scratch with analogous performance to those of the Surprise library from peers following a class leaderboard.

**Solar-Powered Smart Lighting for Sustainable Living**&nbsp;(Team Project)

- Built a solar-powered data science IoT device capable of collecting live sensor data, adjusting lighting depending on environmental factors for energy efficiency, and sending data to a MySQL database using MCU on-board Wifi (synchronous communication).
- Performed an analysis of solar charging voltage under different scenarios and developed a data processing script to query/transform/analyze/visualize data.

**Exploratory and Predictive Analytics for Precision Medicine**&nbsp;(Team Project)

- A data science project for Personalized and Secure Drug Discovery supported by the Semiconductor Research Corp. Scholars Program and PRISM Center at UCSD, mentored by Dr. Niema Moshiri. The project combines intensive exploratory and predictive analyses to identify patterns and predict breast cancer recurrence using biomarkers, medical, and lifestyle data from over 3,000 patients.

**Illuminating Cognizance**&nbsp;(Personal Project)

- A comprehensive look into major power outages in the U.S. to assess statistical relationships (part 1) through exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, data missingness assessment, and predictive power (part 2) using supervised machine learning models and feature engineering, built in pipelines with evaluation comprising diverse accuracy metrics and cogent assessments.
