## About my team

Levin Johnston is a top-performing investment advisory team at Marcus & Millichap, built on long-term relationships, thoughtful analysis, and a genuine commitment to helping investors make confident real estate decisions across the United States.

Our work began in apartments and has grown to include self-storage, net-lease, and retail investment sales. Along the way, we’ve partnered with private investors, developers, and institutions through acquisitions, dispositions, and broader portfolio planning. We focus on values beyond transactional brokerage, we take the time to understand each client’s objectives, risk tolerance, and long-term vision.

Levin Johnston is known for disciplined underwriting, deep local market knowledge, and a relationship-driven approach. By combining the reach of a national platform with localized insight, we serve as advisors through changing market cycles to help our clients make informed decisions that align with their broader investment and wealth-building goals.

## About me

From the San Francisco Bay Area, born and raised in Vietnam.

I specialize in retail & medical office property investment advisory as part of the Levin Johnston Group at Marcus & Millichap, supporting clients in acquisitions, dispositions, development, and 1031 exchanges.

Prior to joining the team, I lived in beautiful San Diego for four years, where I gained experience across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors — including private capital lending, development, city planning, landscape architecture, software engineering, and data science — in both academia at UC San Diego and professional practice. 

Graduate from UC San Diego ('25) with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science, a Bachelor of Science in Real Estate & Development, and a minor in Urban Studies & Planning.
