Hi 👋! I am a **Student in the [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu) at [University of California San Diego 🔱](https://www.ucsd.edu)**.

Born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 🇻🇳.

I am pursuing a BS degree in Data Science, with a plan to double major in Real Estate and Development. I firmly believe that Data is giving rise to a new digital economy that possesses invaluable insights and solutions to solving the world's most challenging problems! In acknowledging the potential of my education, I strive to continually expand my capabilities and always give my best effort to every task and responsibility.
